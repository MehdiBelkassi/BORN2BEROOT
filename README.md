# What I Learned
The Born2beroot project introduced me to the fundamentals of systems administration, Linux system configuration, and essential security practices. Below is a summary of the knowledge and skills I gained:

# 1. Virtual Machines
Installed and configured a virtual machine using VirtualBox or UTM.
Understood the importance of virtual environments for safe and isolated testing.
# 2. Linux Essentials
Explored Debian-based distributions and their features.
Gained experience with basic and advanced command-line operations.
# 3. User and Group Management
Created and managed users and groups, assigning appropriate permissions.
Implemented user restrictions to follow the principle of least privilege.
# 4. Service Configuration
Installed and configured services such as SSH to enable secure remote access.
Learned how to enable and manage services with systemctl.
# 5. Firewall Configuration
Configured UFW (Uncomplicated Firewall) to secure the system by managing incoming and outgoing traffic.
Set specific rules to allow or deny access to certain ports.
# 6. Password Policies
Enforced strong password policies by configuring PAM (Pluggable Authentication Module).
Implemented rules to ensure password complexity, expiration, and history.
# 7. File and Directory Permissions
Understood file permission systems in Linux (rwx) and used chmod, chown, and chgrp to control access.
Applied ACLs (Access Control Lists) for more granular permission control.
# 8. Monitoring and Logs
Utilized tools like top, htop, and df to monitor system performance.
Reviewed system logs using journalctl and log files in /var/log to identify potential issues.
# 9. Security Awareness
Secured the system against common vulnerabilities.
Disabled unnecessary services and ports to reduce attack vectors.
# 10. Automation
Wrote basic scripts for repetitive tasks to save time and reduce errors.
Key Takeaways
System Hardening: A properly configured system is secure and stable.
Attention to Detail: Small misconfigurations can lead to vulnerabilities.
Persistence: Debugging and troubleshooting are essential skills for administrators.
